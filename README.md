# Competitive-Coding

This is where I keep some of my competitive coding snippets and also some algorithms and notebooks.
Feel free to add codes and send pull requests.

Every code in this repo has been tested in some sort of problem.

A small part of the codes do have some words in portuguese but usually they're not essential for the understanding.
If you find any mistake please contact me.
